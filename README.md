Process Manager Plugin keeps track of all your "long running jobs". It adds a native GUI and a new portlet for your Dashboard. You can also create Executables and run them with one click. (It's planned to integrate a CRON like Syntax for recurring tasks)

## Plugins using Process Manager

 - [DataDefinitions](https://github.com/w-vision/DataDefinitions)

## Getting started
 * Install via composer ```composer require dpfaffenbauer/process-manager:^2.0```
 * Enable via command-line (or inside the pimcore extension manager): ```bin/console pimcore:bundle:enable ProcessManagerBundle```
 * Install via command-line (or inside the pimcore extension manager): ```bin/console pimcore:bundle:install ProcessManagerBundle```
 * Reload Pimcore
 * Open Tools -> Process Manager

## Integrate to your Task

### Create new Process

```php
$processFactory = $container->get('process_manager.factory.process');
$process = $processFactory->createProcess(
    sprintf(
        'Process (%s): %s',
        $date->formatLocalized('%A %d %B %Y'),
        'Special Long Running Task'
    ),                                                  //Name
    'special_task',                                     //Type
    'Message',                                          //Message Text
    100,                                                //Total Steps
    0                                                   //Current Step
);
$process->save();                                       //Save
```

### Advance the Progress

```php
$process->progress();
$process->save();
```

### Finish the Progress

```php
$process->setProgress($process->getTotal());
$process->save();
```

## Using the Process Logger
Process Manager also provides you with the ability to Log what exactly happens in your progress.

```php
$logger = $container->get('process_manager.logger');

//Logs a emergency message
$logger->emergency($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a alert message
$logger->alert($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a critical message
$logger->critical($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a error message
$logger->error($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a warning message
$logger->warning($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a notice message
$logger->notice($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a info message
$logger->info($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');

//Logs a debug message
$logger->debug($process, 'Total of 100 entries found');
```

## Reports
You can also further process the log to create a pretty report. To do that, you have to create
a new service and implement the interface `ProcessManagerBundle\Report\ReportInterface`.
Import Definitions has an example implementation of that [Import Definition Report](https://github.com/w-vision/ImportDefinitions/blob/master/src/ImportDefinitionsBundle/ProcessManager/ImportDefinitionsReport.php)



## Add a new Process Type
 * Add a new Class to your Bundle and implement ``ProcessManagerBundle\Process\ProcessInterface``` Interface
 * Add a new Form Type to your Bundle and add required fields to it
 * Add a new Service with tag ```process_manager.process```
  ```yml
        import_definition.process_manager.process:
            class: Wvision\Bundle\ImportDefinitionsBundle\ProcessManager\ImportDefinitionProcess
            tags:
            - { name: 'process_manager.process', type: 'importdefinition', form-type: 'Wvision\Bundle\ImportDefinitionsBundle\Form\Type\ProcessManager\ImportDefinitionsType' }
  ```
 * Thats it, done. (You still need to handle Process creation within your Bundle yourself, there is no magic behind it)

## Stoppable processes
You can implement your process to be stoppable by user via the admin panel.
You need to set the stoppable flag of the process to true and it's status to `ProcessManagerBundle::STATUS_RUNNING`
for the stop button to shop up:

```
$process->setStoppable(true);
$process->setStatus(ProcessManagerBundle::STATUS_RUNNING);
$process->save();
```

Additionally, you need to implement stop logic to your process. Track the process status and stop your process if it's set to `ProcessManagerBundle::STATUS_STOPPING`:

```php
$process = $this->processRepository->find($processId);
if ($process->getStatus() == ProcessManagerBundle::STATUS_STOPPING) {
    // Here goes your process stop and cleanup logic
    ...
    
    $process->setStatus(ProcessManagerBundle::STATUS_STOPPED); // remember to set the status to stopped.
    $process->save();    
}
```
## Cleanup command

You can execute a cleanup command from the console to delete old process entries and log files. To do this on a regular basis, you can add it as a cronjob. 

```bash
# delete all process entries from the database and log files older than 604800 seconds (7 days)
$ ./bin/console process-manager:cleanup-process-data
 
# delete all process entries from the database and log files older than 86400 seconds (1 days)
$ ./bin/console process-manager:cleanup-process-data --seconds=86400

# delete only process entries from the database older than 604800 seconds (7 days) and keep the log files
$ ./bin/console process-manager:cleanup-process-data --keeplogs
```
